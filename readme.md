## About
In this project, a fictional Brazilian company aims to enter the American fashion market by setting up an e-commerce store for selling men's jeans. The objective is to keep the operating costs low and scale up as they acquire more customers. 

In addition to defining the target audience and product, the company wishes to gain insights into the American market for this segment, in order to set competitive prices for its products.

The company considers its main competitor to be the H&M, a real large-scale American fashion company. Thus, the Brazilian company hires a Data Science consulting firm to answer some business problem questions.
