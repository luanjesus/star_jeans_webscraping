# STAR JEANS - Data Science Project

In this project, a fictional Brazilian company aims to enter the American fashion market by setting up an e-commerce store for selling men's jeans.

The objective is to keep the operating costs low and scale up as they acquire more customers. In addition to defining the target audience and product, the company wishes to gain insights into the American market for this segment, in order to set competitive prices for its products. 

The company considers its main competitor to be the H&M, a real large-scale American fashion company. Thus, the Brazilian company hires a Data Science consulting firm to answer some business problem questions.

## 1. Business Problem

    What is the best price selling price for each pants model?
    How many types of pants and colors does H&M?
    What are the necessary raw materials for making these pants the comparing with the main competitor ?

To answer these questions, I created an automatic ETL (extract, transform and load data) process with web scraping to collect the data from H&M website. I let it collect data for a few days, inserting it into an SQLite database. And after this process, I did the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each business problem.

## 2. Tasks to answer the questions:

    Analyze where and what data can be extracted from the H&M website.
    Extract the Data.
    Define the Schema (table columns).
    Define the Infrastructure (API, csv, txt, database).
    Design the ETL process.
    Schedule the table update.
    Answer business problem with EDA.
    Deliver the final product.

## 3. Tools
    Python
    Pandas
	Numpy
	Regex
	Requests API
	Beautiful Soup
	SQLite	
	Jupyter Notebook
